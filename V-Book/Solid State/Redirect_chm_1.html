                        of large molecules, or a mixture of molecules whose movements are more restricted, often form
                        amorphous solids. For examples, candle waxes are amorphous solids composed of large hydrocarbon
                        molecules. Some substances, such as silicon dioxide (shown in Figure 2), can form either
                        crystalline or amorphous solids, depending on the conditions under which it is produced. Also,
                        amorphous solids may undergo a transition to the crystalline state under appropriate conditions.

                        Many ionic crystals also have high melting points. This is due to the very strong attractions
                        between the ionsâ€”in ionic compounds, the attractions between full charges are (much) larger than
                        those between the partial charges in polar molecular compounds. This will be looked at in more
                        detail in a later discussion of lattice energies. Although they are hard, they also tend to be
                        brittle, and they shatter rather than bend. Ionic solids do not conduct electricity; however,
                        they do conduct when molten or dissolved because their ions are free to move. Many simple
                        compounds formed by the reaction of a metallic element with a nonmetallic element are ionic.

                    <h4>>> Frenkel defect : This type of defect is created when an ion leaves its appropriate site in
                        the
                        lattice and occupies an interstitial site. A hole or vacancy is thus produced in the lattice.
                        The electroneutrality of the crystal is maintained since the number of positive and negative
                        ions is the same. Since positive ions are small, in size, they usually leave their positions in
                        the lattice and occupy interstitial positions. It is also called dislocation defect.
                        Frenkel defect is exhibited in ionic compounds in which the radius ratio [r+/râ€“] is low. The
                        cations and anions differ much in their sizes and the ions have low co-ordination numbers.
                        Examples are ZnS, AgBr, AgI, AgCl.</h4>
